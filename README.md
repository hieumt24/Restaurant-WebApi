## API - What it is ?
    - API (Application Programming Interface), is a set of definitions and protocols that enable one application or system to communicate and cooperate with others. You can think of it as a set of rule that define how different software components should work together.
    - Key guidelines for REST API design : 
        + Stateless 
        + Cacheable
        + Layerd system
        + Uniformed interface 
        + HATEOAS
